# Note

The thesis format is ugly, so I decided to use Tufte's handout format instead.
The aim of the `iiumthesis` class is to help prepare a thesis.
This manual, however, has no such aim.

# Usage

Start with a scaffholding of your document as such:

```
\documentclass{iiumthesis}

\begin{document}

\tableofcontents

% CONTENT HERE

\end{document}
```

# Limitations

## LaTeX

To be filled in later.

## Pandoc
